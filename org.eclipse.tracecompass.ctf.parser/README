This file describes how to build the CTF Java parser files. They are stored in
the git repository (to avoid additional compile-time dependencies), but if you
do modify the .g files in src/, you should rebuild the resulting .java files and
commit them.

To rebuild the parser files, run Maven with the "ctf-grammar" profile, as such:
$ mvn clean install -Pctf-grammar

Alternatively, you can also run the "generate-grammar.sh" script to regenerate
the parser files. That script requires "antlr3" to be installed on the system.
